# TodoMVC with Rails

  * Rails 4.0
  * jQuery & Ajax
  * [Demo on Heroku](http://todomvc-with-rails.herokuapp.com)

## Techniques

  This TodoMVC is an experiment, trying to see how a standard Rails
  and jQuery setup compares against the variety of client-side
  MVC frameworks out there.

  Techniques learned from these sources are applied:

  * [Railscast #136: jQuery & Ajax](http://railscasts.com/episodes/136-jquery-ajax-revised)
  * [TodoMVC with Vanilla Javascript](http://todomvc.com/vanilla-examples/vanillajs/)
  * [TodoMVC with jQuery](http://todomvc.com/architecture-examples/jquery/)
  * [TodoMVC on Rails](https://github.com/smidwap/todomvc_on_rails)

## Moving onwards

  I welcome and value improvements and discussion. Just open an issue or send a PR.
